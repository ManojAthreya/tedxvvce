                                    Mother of 2/ Business Owner/ Krateka/ Kickboxer/ MMA Fighter/ Powerlifter Anjali lives to break stereotypes. Brought up in Mysore, her earliest memories are of riding horses with the Mysore Mounted Police. She excelled in volleyball, kho-kho & throwball, and won Silver in Kabaddi at the State Dasara Sports in 1996. She moved to the US and worked while going to college in the evenings and weekends, in New York City. With the birth of her children and with the tugs of being a full time mom, she threw herself into learning the Tabla, and Ukulele, mixing songs on Garageband, resulting in a few re-imagined Shlokas on YouTube. Once back, she found herself single with her children, overweight, and depressed, while having to deal with the stresses of Indian life that she hadn't been a part of for over a decade. Not being one for "gymming", a friend suggested MMA. In September 2014, she stepped into her first MMA class, and the rest, is History.
